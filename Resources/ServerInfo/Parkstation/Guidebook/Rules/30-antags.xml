# Rule 30
## Antagonists exist to move the round forward and make things interesting and fun for everyone involved. The point isn't to "win", kill everyone else, or anything like that.

Do not spawn camp or prevent others from entering the round safely.

Team antag objectives take precedence over solo antag objectives.

Ghost roles must follow their description upon taking said role.

Try to play with some standard improv and RP sense. The world isn't expected of you, but putting effort into being an interesting element of the round is.
