# Rule 17
## Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").

A [color=#52B4E9]Medical Doctor[/color] does not need insulated gloves, and the [color=#334E6D]Head of Personnel[/color] does not need to give themself armory access so they can go grab a gun.

Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or death poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
  - Dangerous tools are dangerous tools, regardless of whether it's a fire axe, a full set of construction tools, or a gun. If you are not authorized or don't have a good reason to have them, expect [color=#6494F0]Security[/color] to take them away, and Admins to get involved if the situation warrants it.
  - [color=#DC143C]Read Standard Operating Procedure[/color]
