# Rule 19
## If you sign up for a Command or Security role, you are expected to know the basics of the game, your job, and the job(s) you supervise, if any.

Failure to know your job or how to play the game in general as [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] or [color=#6494F0]Security[/color] is liable to result in a job ban.

As a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] or [color=#6494F0]Security[/color] role, don't make friends with antagonists and trade contraband with them.

Don't engage in common troublemaker behavior and lawbreaking as a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] or [color=#6494F0]Security[/color] role.

Do not immediately abandon your position as a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the station.
- As a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] role, do not take over the jobs of others. The [color=#334E6D]HoP[/color] is not the [color=#6494F0]HoS[/color], for instance, and holds no direct power over Sec.
- The [color=#334E6D]HoP[/color] is not the Captain. Any [color=#334E6D]HoP[/color] or other [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] members who give themselves all access without reason or permission are liable for arrest and demotion.
