# Rule 11
## Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who want to enjoy the game.

Do not intentionally make other players' times worse for your own amusement.

The round ends when the summary pops up on your screen. Until then, RP is still expected. Also remember that just because you're wrapped up doesn't mean there's no one at the end of the round finishing their story.
