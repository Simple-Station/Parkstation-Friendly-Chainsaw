# Rule 20
## Security should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests.

Cases where lethal force is allowed:
- Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons). Note your first option should still be to stun, but if your life is in danger, you can do what you must.
- You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger.
- If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew.
