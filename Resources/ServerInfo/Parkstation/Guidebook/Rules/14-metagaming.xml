# Rule 14
## Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").

Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating as a ghost, through screenshots, Metacomming, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden.

Unless otherwise stated, if you take a ghost role, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.
The line is blurry for cloning in regards to what you can recall, but generally speaking, try to remember whatever makes the story the most interesting. Note that this almost always will [color=#DC143C]not[/color] include the person who led to your death.
