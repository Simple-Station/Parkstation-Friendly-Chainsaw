# Rule 2
## Absolutely no hate speech or bigotry.

We tolerate some amount of [color=#bbbbbb]IC[/color] specism, so long as it is not analogous to real-world slurs, and you can justify it [color=#bbbbbb]IC[/color].
If you are the recipient of said specism, you are free to retaliate, and face consequences for said retaliation.
