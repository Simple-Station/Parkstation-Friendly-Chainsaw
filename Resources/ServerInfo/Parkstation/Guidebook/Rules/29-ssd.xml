# Rule 29
## Do your best not to interact negatively with SSD/AFK players. Moving them to safety is acceptable; killing, looting, or otherwise griefing them while they are away is not.

SSD characters are players who are disconnected or AFK. It is possible for players to return to SSD bodies. Players become catatonic when they take a ghost spawner role or commit suicide. Players are NOT able to return to these bodies without admin intervention.

If the player in question is an antag target or they are being secured by [color=#6494F0]Security[/color], interactions to finish what is required of your duties/objectives are always acceptable but consider contacting Admins for a more fitting resolution if necessary.
