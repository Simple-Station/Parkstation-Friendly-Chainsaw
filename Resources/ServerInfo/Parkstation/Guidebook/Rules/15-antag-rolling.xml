# Rule 15
## Don't immediately ghost, suicide, or cryostasis if you do not get an antagonist role (referred to as "Antag-rolling").

This is not fair to other players actually waiting patiently for an antagonist round or wanting good staff. Alternatively, if you do not want to play an antagonist or do not want to cause conflict, do not opt in for antagonist roles. This will be managed as any other wholly [color=#66bbff]OOC[/color] action.
