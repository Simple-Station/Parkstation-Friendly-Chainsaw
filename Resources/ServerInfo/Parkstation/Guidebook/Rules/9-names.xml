# Rule 9
## Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name.

- Names don't have to be entirely realistic, but should still make sense, as this is a game set quite far in the "future". Extra leeway beyond this is given to Clowns, Mimes, and non-human species.
- Names of notable famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden.
- Names that are LRP/NRP or straight up inappropriate will likely get you a ban.
- Using a terrible name will give the admins permission to whatever to you.
