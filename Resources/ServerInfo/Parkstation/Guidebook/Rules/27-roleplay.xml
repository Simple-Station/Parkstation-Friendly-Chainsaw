# Rule 27
## This server is a "Roleplay Expected" server. We define this as performing your assigned duties, "doing your job". This means it is important to do what is expected of your department and not what would be expected of other departments.

Don't do other people's jobs for them. Opt for the role you intend to play or change your job by visiting the [color=334E6D]Head of Personnel[/color].

Failure to do your basic duties may result in a job or game ban.
